# Ps-Vita-Command-HTML-launcher
The main focus of this is to launch the command 'psns:' from HTML to your Ps Vita Browser.

To find other products or games to load not install, look for the CID that looks like this: CID=JP0700-PCSG00516_00-DSDLCQUEST000012

When you load a dlc from another region, you might find that it's already in English.

This is also a good way to find games or apps that were removed from Search in the PSN Store.
